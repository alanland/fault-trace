# Fault Trace

Fault Trace is a 12-month-long project that explores data sonification. Each month a new song will be released based on earthquake data from that month.

Each song will be unique in style, time signature, tempo, and time acceleration.

Fault Trace is built with Processing, Python, and Ableton Live.

This song was inspired by artists such as Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin.
